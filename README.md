# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Preventing heart diseases is crucial, and data-driven systems play a vital role in prediction, research, and prevention. In this project, a dataset of heart disease patients underwent thorough analysis and data processing. Various machine learning models were applied, and predictions were made using different algorithms.
